Introduction
============

These are instructions to upgrade from earlier Horde Groupware Webmail Edition
versions.  Please backup your existing data before running any of the steps
described below, you need the backups in case anything goes wrong with the
upgrade process, which cannot be reverted automatically. You can't use the
updated data with your old Horde Groupware Webmail Edition version anymore.

Please see below for changes between certain Horde Groupware versions that are
not covered by the update script.


Upgrading any Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 4 or later
========================================================

Upgrading Horde Groupware Webmail Edition is as easy as running::

   pear upgrade -a -B horde/webmail

If you want to upgrade from a Horde Groupware Webmail Edition version
prior to 4.0, please follow the instructions in INSTALL_ to install
the most recent Horde Groupware Webmail Edition version using the PEAR
installer.

After updating to a newer Horde Groupware Webmail Edition version, you
**always** need to update configurations and database schemes. Log in
as an administrator, go to Administration => Configuration and update
anything that's highlighted as outdated.

===========================================================


-----------
Base Module

It is now possible to configure Horde-wide settings for a NoSQL database
backend. Addtionally, several Horde packages now allow a NoSQL backend driver
to be used.

The Memcache configuration options have been deprecated and have been replaced
by the generic Horde_HashTable package (which supports both Memcache and Redis
servers). Although the previous memcache configuration will continue to work
in Horde 5.x, it is recommended to upgrade to the new 'hashtable'
configuration setup.

The following options were removed::

   $conf['cache']['compress']
   $conf['cachecssparams']['compress']

-----------
Mail Module
-----------


Server Options (imp/config/backends.php)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sorting on non-IMAP servers, or IMAP servers that do not support the SORT
extension, has been disabled by default in IMP 6.1. To restore the old
behavior (NOT RECOMMENDED), see the 'sort_force' option in
``config/backends.local.php``.

The 'debug' option has been added to the SMTP configuration.

IMAP/POP caching can now be done using database backends (see documentation
for the 'cache' parameter).

The following quota drivers have been removed::

   Command
   Maildir
   Mdaemon
   Mercury32
   Sql


Configuration Options (imp/config/conf.php)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The $conf['user']['allow_folders'] option has been removed. This can now be
set per-backend using the Horde permissions system.

The $conf['server']['fixed_folders'] option has been removed. Preventing
actions on a specific mailbox can be controlled via native IMAP ACLs or,
alternatively, by the 'mbox_acl' hook.

The $conf['user']['autocreate_special'] option has been removed. This can now
be set on a per-backend basis in ``config/backends.local.php``
('autocreate_special' option).

The $conf['msgsettings']['filtering'] and $conf['msgsettings']['replacement']
options have been removed. This feature has been moved to the 'msg_filter'
hook.

The following spam-reporting options have been removed and can now be
configured per-backend in ``config/backends.local.php``::

   $conf['notspam']['email']
   $conf['notspam']['email_format']

word checking code that previously was provided as an example in the
'pre_sent' hook.

The 'compose_attach' hook has been removed and replaced by the
'compose_attachment' hook. Both hooks are designed for the same purpose;
however, the arguments have been completely changed so it is safest to
entirely deprecate usage of the previous hook.

The 'mbox_readonly' hook has been removed. Mailbox permissions can instead be
controlled via native IMAP ACLs or, alternatively, by the 'mbox_acl' hook.

The 'mbox_special' hook has been removed. Additional special mailboxes can
now be defined per-backend in ``config/backends.local.php``.

The 'mailboxarray' and 'msglist_flags' hooks have been altered to remove the
second argument ($mode). If the current view mode is needed, it can be
obtained via a call to $GLOBALS['registry']->getView().

The 'spam_email' hook has been removed. This configuration can now be defined
per-backend in ``config/backends.local.php``.

The $html argument to the 'trailer' hook has been added.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default values for these preferences have been changed::

   request_mdn

The following preferences are no longer used and may be safely removed from
your preference backend (only after all users have logged in - these
preferences MAY be used to automatically upgrade to new preferences when
a user logs into IMP 6 for the first time)::

   compose_bcc
   compose_cc
   link_attach


API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

These API calls have been added::

   - getMaillog
   - getMaillogChanges

Webmail Edition 4.

The $conf['cachejsparams']['url_version_param'] option was added. This option

with a very short notice. The weather.com portal block has been removed and

Upgrading a Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 1.x
===============================================

For upgrading from a Horde Groupware Webmail Edition version 1.x to
4.0 or later, see the section `Upgrading any Horde Groupware Webmail
Edition 4 or later`_.

The update script will automatically migrate database backends and
update configuration files. It will add new and changed configurations
at the end of existing configuration files, any changes done to old
configuration files won't get lost, but might get overridden by new
settings. You might want to check the updated configuration files
after the update script has finished to make sure that any
customizations that you did to the old version still work as expected.

The ``.dist`` versions of the configuration files alway contain the most
recent reference settings and the settings documentation. If you experience
any problems with the configuration files after an update, or if you want
cleaner configuration files without all the updating code, you can create
fresh versions from the ``.dist`` files.

These instructions are supposed to be used with a complete tarball of the new
Horde Groupware Webmail Edition version. They don't work if you use a patch
file to upgrade your installation, because the patch already contains all
configuration file changes that the update script is going to add.

1. Extract the tarball of the new version **in parallel** to the old
   version. See the INSTALL_ file details how to unpack a tarball.

   If you want to replace the old version with the new version eventually, you
   should move the old version to a different place now and put the new
   version in the place of the old one. You can still do this later, if you
   want to, but you have to edit the configuration file then.

2. Start the setup script::

     ./scripts/setup.php

3. Choose the update option in the setup menu and answer the questions from
   the setup script.

4. Pray.

5. If everything went fine and without any error messages, point your browser
   to the URL of the new version and log in as an administrator. Go to the
   ``Administration -> Setup`` screen and update all configurations that are
   marked as being outdated.

6. If you want to replace the old version with the new one, and if you didn't
   do this already in step 1, you can do it now. But you have to edit the
   configuration file ``config/conf.php`` manually and change the setting
   ``$conf['cookie']['path']`` to match the new URL path. Otherwise you won't
   be able to login after you moved Horde Groupware Webmail Edition to a
   different directory.
